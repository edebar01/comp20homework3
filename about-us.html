		Who We Are 
	</h2>
	<h4>
		The inspiration for The Lovely Loaf was born out of quarantine hobbies of the 2020 Covid-19 pandemic. While the world was shut away in quarantine, our bakery's founders struggled to entertain themselves and stumbled into the glorious world of sourdough-making. Our founders graduated college and, not being able to find work during the Covid-19 recession, brought The Lovely Loaf to life.

		Our Mission 
	</h2>
	<h4>
		We pride ourselves on baking what the people want and crave. Our founding was based in experimentation, and our continued success has been the result of constant innovation and creativity! We love suggestions for new loaves, and we always do our best to offer the most delicious, and perhaps underrated, creations to our loyal customers.
