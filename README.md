# The Lovely Loaf
Name of the business or organization: The Lovely Loaf

What the business does (i.e., what is its product/service/mission): This business is an artisanal bread shop that I created in my imagination. The business sells fresh baked loaves of bread and also sells frozen dough that people can order online. 

Who is the target demographic of the business: The target demographic of this business is bread-lovers of all ages, but probably 20 years and older, with the biggest target among 30-year-olds and 60+ year-olds. This business is targetted towards people who enjoy homemade and artisanal products--the type of people who shop at health-food stores and go to farmer's markets.
